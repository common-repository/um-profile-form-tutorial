### UM Profile Form Tutorial

Many new users the majority of the time don't know how to fill out a profile page form properly. This add-on for the Ultimate Member plugin ("UM") allows admins to provide users with a step by step guided virtual tour to fill out an UM profile form. This plugin uses javascript code to create pop up bubbles with comments and back/next buttons and is a custom version of WP-Tutorial.  

The default 'tour.js' helps users fill out the form with 8 elements, but it can manually be modified to add many more and to target any element in the profile page form. 

It's assumed that Ultimate Member ("UM") plugin is installed. The plugin is 100% compatible with Ultimate Member up to version 1.3.26
